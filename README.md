1) Clone repository
2) Add folder "Data" from OSF ([LINK](https://osf.io/f9hjx/files/osfstorage)) including single subject data sets and merged data sets to directory
3) Run skripts in R, (you can start running them from "## FOR DATA ANALYSIS READ PREPROCESSED FILES HERE #####" if you just want to run inference statistics)
   Make sure, that the working directory is the folder, where all the scripts and the data folder live

   In case you need files EDA_unified.RData or ET_ga_unified.RData, copy them from the data folder from OSF directly into your working directory (where the other RData
   files also live)
