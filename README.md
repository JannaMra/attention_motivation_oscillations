1) Clone repository
2) Add folder "Data" from OSF ([LINK](https://osf.io/f9hjx/files/osfstorage)) including single subject data sets and merged data sets to directory
3) Run skripts in R, (you can start running them from "## FOR DATA ANALYSIS READ PREPROCESSED FILES HERE #####" if you just want to run inference statistics)
   Change working directory to the folder, where all the scripts and the data folder live
